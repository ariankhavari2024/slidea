# render.yaml
# Blueprint for deploying the SlideaAI Flask application on Render
# Defining Database and Redis as Private Services (pserv)

services:
  # PostgreSQL Database (as a Private Service)
  - type: pserv
    name: slidea-db
    env: postgres # Hint for Render to use PostgreSQL
    plan: starter # IMPORTANT: Use a paid plan for persistence. Disk settings are managed in Render UI for pserv.

  # Redis Cache/Broker (as a Private Service)
  - type: pserv
    name: slidea-redis
    env: redis # Hint for Render to use Redis
    plan: free # Free tier is usually okay for Redis cache/broker initially

  # Flask Web Service (using Gunicorn)
  - type: web
    name: slidea-web
    env: docker # Build and run using the Dockerfile
    plan: starter # IMPORTANT: Use a paid plan (e.g., starter) for non-sleeping service
    # healthCheckPath: / # Optional: Add a basic health check endpoint in Flask if needed
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile # Path to your Dockerfile relative to the root
    # dockerContext: . # Optional: Specify build context if Dockerfile isn't in root
